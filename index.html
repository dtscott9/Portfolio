            This is a website I developed for the Professional Employment
            Organization Permastaff. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.

            As part of the Web Development Society, we had form teams of 3 to
            develop a website for the BPA (Business Professionals of America)
            competition in Boise, Idaho. The theme we were given was that of a
            used car dealership. One of my main tasks for the project was to
            create Json files that would hold information about all of the
            different vehicles we would feature on our site. I then had to
            create two dynamic web pages, one for the vehicle listings and One
            for the individual vehicle. These pages would display whichever
            vehicle info the user selected. I also created a loan estimator as
            shown below. This allowed the user to see a loan estimate for a
            particular vehicle price on the site, or for a custom value they
            entered in.

            This is a Star Wars encyclopedia I made from a Star Wars API. I used
            C++ with the JsonCPP library to open Json files (I put the api
            content in a json file so it was easier to read in C++) and the
            OpenCV library to display images.

            I made this project using Kotlin in Android Studio. It started out
            as just a simple hangman game to learn the ins and outs of Kotlin,
            but after I finished it I wanted to add more, specifically the
            ability to save high scores in a Firestore database. I also wanted
            to learn how to do animations in Android studio so I implemented
            those as well.
